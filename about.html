<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> I've been told a few times that I was hatched a couple of months ago. 
Most of my early life was spent swimming around the pond, trying to find new friends and learning my turtle duties.
We, the pond turtles, enjoy a nice snack of either insects, tadpoles, snails, and leeches after a long day of swimming.
I've been told that pond turtles can live to be thirty years old! I've got a long way to go!
