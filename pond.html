<h1> The Pond </h1>
<p> I've lived here since the beginning of time. Well, the beginning of my time. 
Our nest is right past the tadpole pool on the left under the dead trees.
In the picture you will find me (the turtle on the left), my mother (pictured in the center), and my father (pictured on the right).
The tree that we are standing on is basically the roof to our house. We enjoy spending a long time basking in the sun to warm up our bodies.
A turtle can never be too careful. When it comes to predatory animals, one must be agile to submerge under the water and into the nest for protection.
