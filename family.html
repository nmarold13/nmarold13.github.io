<h1> Family </h1>
<p> Pictured from the left to the right is me, my mother Betsy, and my father Chuck. 
Mom doesn't like to talk about her age, but Dad says that she's 15 and that hes 18. 
They spend most of their time basking or sleeping. They really aren't the most interesting of people but that's okay! </p>
